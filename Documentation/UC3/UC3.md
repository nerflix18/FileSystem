# UC 3 - Create directory

As user I want to create a directory.

## Analysis

- User types `mkdir path/DIRECTORY_NAME` to create a new directory. System creates a new directory in the path indicated in command.

### Restrictions

1. DIRECTORY_NAME already exits in that path.
    - System alerts the user for that and directory isn't created.
